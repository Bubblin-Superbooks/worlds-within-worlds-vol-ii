If the 7 protons were all +&frac12; and the 4 electrons were all -&frac12; in their spins, the nuclear spin would be ⁷/₂ - ⁴/₂ = &sup3;/₂.</p><p>If you have an odd number of particles in the nucleus, you will find that any combination of positive and negative spins will never give you either zero or a whole number as a sum. The sum will always include a fraction.</p><p>Consequently, if one measures the spin of a particular atomic nucleus one can tell at once whether that nucleus contains an even number of particles or an odd number.</p></div> </div>
