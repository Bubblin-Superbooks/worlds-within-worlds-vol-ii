<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>What Rutherford did not (and could not) take into account were the consequences of a completely new type of nuclear bombardment involving a type of particle unknown in the 1920s (though Rutherford speculated about the possibility of its existence).</p><p>The beginnings of the new path came about through the reluctant realization that there was a flaw in the apparently firmly grounded proton-electron picture of nuclear structure.</p><p>The flaw involved the &ldquo;nuclear spin&rdquo;. In 1924 the Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958) worked out a theory that treated protons and electrons as though they were spinning on their axes. This spin could be in either direction (or, as we would say in earthly terms, from west-to-east, or from east-to-west). Quantum theory has shown that a natural unit exists for what is called the angular momentum of this spin.</p></div> </div>
