Secondly, it would have to be short-range, for no attractive force between protons of any kind was ever detected outside the nucleus.</p><p>In addition, this short-range attraction would have to involve the neutron. The hydrogen-1 nucleus was made up of a single proton, but all nuclei containing more than 1 proton had to contain neutrons also to be stable, and only certain numbers of neutrons.</p><p>Until the discovery of the neutron, only two kinds of forces, or &ldquo;interactions&rdquo;, were known in the universe. These were the &ldquo;gravitational interaction&rdquo; and the &ldquo;electromagnetic interaction&rdquo;. The electromagnetic interaction was much the stronger of the two&mdash;trillions and trillions and trillions of times as strong as the gravitational attraction.</p></div> </div>
