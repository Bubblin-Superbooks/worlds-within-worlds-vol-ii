At the speed of light, which Einstein showed was a limiting velocity that an observer would never reach, the discrepancy became so great that the speed of the light source, however great, added or subtracted zero to or from the speed of light.</p><p>Accompanying this were all sorts of other effects. It could be shown by Einstein&rsquo;s reasoning that no object possessing mass could move faster than the speed of light. What&rsquo;s more, as an object moved faster and faster, its length in the direction of motion (as measured by a stationary 72 observer) grew shorter and shorter, while its mass grew greater and greater.</p></div> </div>
