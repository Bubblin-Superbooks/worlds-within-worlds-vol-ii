<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A neutron didn&rsquo;t always enter a nucleus that it encountered. Sometimes, if it struck the nucleus a hard, glancing blow, it bounced off. If the nucleus struck by the neutron is many times as massive as the neutron, the neutron bounced off with all its speed practically intact. On the other hand, if the neutron hits a nucleus not very much more massive than itself, the nucleus rebounds and absorbs some of the energy, so that the neutron bounces away with less energy than it had. If the neutron rebounds from a number of comparatively light nuclei, it eventually loses virtually all its energy and finally moves about quite slowly, possessing no more energy than the atoms that surround it.</p><p>(You can encounter this situation in ordinary life in the case of billiard balls.</p></div> </div>
