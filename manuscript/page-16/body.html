<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>If the ball were thrown forward at 20 kilometers an hour by a man on top of a flatcar that is moving backward at 20 kilometers an hour, then the ball (to someone watching from the roadside) would seem to be not moving at all after it left the hand of the thrower. It would just drop to the ground.</p><p>There seemed no reason in the 19th century to suppose that light didn&rsquo;t behave in the same fashion. It was known to travel at the enormous speed of just a trifle under 300,000 kilometers per second, while earth moved in its orbit about the sun at a speed of about 30 kilometers per second. Surely if a beam of light beginning at some earth-bound source shone in the direction of earth&rsquo;s travel, it ought to move at a speed of 300,030 kilometers per second.</p></div> </div>
