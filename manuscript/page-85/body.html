<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>All the particles and rays that can leave a detectable track of ions behind are called &ldquo;ionizing radiation&rdquo; and these are easy to detect.</p><p>The hypothetical proton-electron combination, however, which was neither a wave form nor a charged particle was not expected to be able to ionize atoms. It would wander among the atoms without either attracting or repelling electrons and would therefore leave the atomic structure intact. Its pathway could not be followed. In short, then, the neutron was, so to speak, invisible, and the search for it 96 seemed a lost cause. And until it was found, the proton-electron theory of nuclear structure, whatever its obvious deficiencies with respect to nuclear spin, remained the only one to work with.</p></div> </div>
