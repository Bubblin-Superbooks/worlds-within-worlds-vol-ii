<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Einstein&rsquo;s theory gave rise to something else as well. Einstein deduced that mass was a form of energy. He worked out a relationship (the &ldquo;mass-energy equivalence&rdquo;) that is expressed as follows:</p><p>E = mc&sup2;</p><p>where E represents energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light.</p><p>If mass is measured in grams and the speed of light is measured in centimeters per second, then the equation will yield the energy in a unit called &ldquo;ergs&rdquo;. It turns out that 1 gram of mass is equal to 900,000,000,000,000,000,000 (900 billion billion) ergs of energy. The erg is a very small unit of energy, but 900 billion billion of them mount up.</p></div> </div>
