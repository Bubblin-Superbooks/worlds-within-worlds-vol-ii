Becker, were bombarding the light metal, beryllium, with alpha particles. Ordinarily, they might expect protons to be knocked out of it, but in this case no protons appeared. They detected some sort of radiation because something was creating certain effects while the alpha particles were bombarding the beryllium but not after the bombardment ceased.</p><p>Walther W. G. Bothe</p><p>To try to determine something about the properties of this radiation, Bothe and Becker tried putting objects in the way of the radiation. They found the radiation to be remarkably penetrating. It even passed through several centimeters of lead. The only form of radiation that was known at that time to come out of bombarded matter with the capacity of penetrating a thick layer of lead was gamma rays. Bothe and Becker, therefore, decided they had produced gamma rays and reported this.</p></div> </div>
