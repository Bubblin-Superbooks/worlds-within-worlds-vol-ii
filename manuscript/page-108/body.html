If a cosmic particle of sufficient energy struck an atomic nucleus in the atmosphere, it might knock mesons out of it.</p><p>In 1936 the American physicists Carl David Anderson (1905- ) and Seth Henry Neddermeyer (1907- ), studying the results of cosmic-particle bombardment of matter, detected the existence of particles of intermediate mass. This particle turned out to be lighter than Yukawa had predicted; it was only about 207 times as massive as an electron. Much worse, it lacked other properties that Yukawa had predicted. It did not interact with the nucleus in the manner expected.</p></div> </div>
