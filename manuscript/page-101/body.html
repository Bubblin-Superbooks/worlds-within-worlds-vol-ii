<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In one place, and only one, did the proton-neutron theory seem a little weaker than the proton-electron theory. The electrons in the nucleus were thought to act as a kind of glue holding together the protons.</p><p>But the electrons were gone. There were no negative charges at all inside the nucleus, only the positive charges of the proton, plus the uncharged neutron. As many as 83 positive charges were to be found (in the bismuth-209 nucleus) squeezed together and yet not breaking apart.</p><p>In the absence of electrons, what kept the protons clinging together?</p><p>Was it possible that the electrical repulsion between 2 protons is replaced by an attraction if those protons were pushed together closely enough? Can there be both an attraction and a repulsion, with the former the more 102 important at very short range? If this were so, that hypothetical attraction would have to have two properties.</p></div> </div>
