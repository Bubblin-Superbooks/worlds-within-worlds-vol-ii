<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>What about the nuclei of elements other than hydrogen?</p><p>All the other elements had nuclei more massive than that of hydrogen and the natural first guess was that these were made up of some appropriate number of protons closely packed together. The helium nucleus, which had a mass four times as great as that of hydrogen, might be made up of 4 protons; the oxygen nucleus with a mass number of 16 might be made up of 16 protons and so on.</p><p>This guess, however, ran into immediate difficulties. A helium nucleus might have a mass number of 4 but it had an electric charge of +2. If it were made up of 4 protons, it ought to have an electric charge of +4. In the same way, an 77 oxygen nucleus made up of 16 protons ought to have a charge of +16, but in actual fact it had one of +8.</p></div> </div>
