<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>C. F. Powell</p><p>(Actually, it turns out that there are two forces. The one with the pion as exchange particle is the &ldquo;strong nuclear interaction&rdquo;. Another, involved in beta particle emission, for instance, is a &ldquo;weak interaction&rdquo;, much weaker than the electromagnetic but stronger than the gravitational.)</p><p>The working out of the details of the strong nuclear interaction explains further the vast energies to be found resulting from nuclear reactions. Ordinary chemical reactions, with the electron shifts that accompany them, involve the electromagnetic interaction only. Nuclear energy, with the 107 shifts of the particles inside the nucleus, involves the much stronger nuclear interaction.</p></div> </div>
