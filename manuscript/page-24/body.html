<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The energy equivalent of 1 gram of mass (and remember that a gram, in ordinary units, is only &sup1;/₂₈ of an ounce) would keep a 100-watt light bulb burning for 35,000 years.</p><p>It is this vast difference between the tiny quantity of mass and the huge amount of energy to which it is equivalent that obscured the relationship over the years. When a chemical reaction liberates energy, the mass of the materials undergoing the reaction decreases slightly&mdash;but very slightly.</p><p>Suppose, for instance, a gallon of gasoline is burned. The gallon of gasoline has a mass of 2800 grams and combines with about 10,000 grams of oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water, yielding 1.35 million billion ergs. That&rsquo;s a lot of energy and it will drive an automobile for some 25 to 30 kilometers. But by Einstein&rsquo;s equation all that energy is equivalent to only a little over a millionth of a gram.</p></div> </div>
