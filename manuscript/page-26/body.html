No wonder, then, that from Lavoisier on, scientists thought that the law of conservation of mass held exactly.</p><p>Radioactive changes gave off much more energy per atom than chemical changes did, and the percentage loss in mass was correspondingly greater. The loss of mass in radioactive changes was found to match the production of energy in just the way Einstein predicted.</p></div> </div>
