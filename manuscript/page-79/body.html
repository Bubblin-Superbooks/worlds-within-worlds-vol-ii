<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This quickly raised a problem. The nuclear spin of the common isotope, nitrogen-14, was measured accurately over and over again and turned out to be 1. There seemed no doubt about that and it could therefore be concluded that there were an even number of particles in the nitrogen-14 nucleus.</p><p>And yet, by the proton-electron theory of nuclear structure, the nitrogen-14 nucleus, with a mass number of 14 and an atomic number of 7, had to be made up of 14 protons and 7 electrons for a total of 21 particles altogether&mdash;an odd number.</p><p>The nuclear spin of nitrogen-14 indicated &ldquo;even number&rdquo; and the proton-electron theory indicated &ldquo;odd number&rdquo;. One or the other had to be wrong, but which? The nuclear spin was a matter of actual measurement, which could be repeated over and over and on which all agreed. The proton-electron theory was only a theory. It was therefore the latter that was questioned.</p></div> </div>
