From the energy involved they could come only out of the nucleus. Since beta particles are electrons and since they come from the nucleus, it seemed to follow that there must be electrons within the nucleus to begin with.</p><p>The proton-electron theory of nuclear structure also seemed to account neatly for many of the facts of radioactivity.</p><p>Why radioactivity at all, for instance? The more complex a nucleus is, the more protons must be squeezed together and the harder, it would seem, it must be to keep them together. More and more electrons seemed to be required.</p></div> </div>
