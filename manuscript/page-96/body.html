<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In the same way uranium-238 would have a nucleus built of 92 protons and 146 neutrons, while uranium-235 would have one of 92 protons and 143 neutrons.</p><p>By the new theory, can we suppose that it is neutrons rather than electrons that somehow hold the protons together against their mutual repulsion, and that more and more neutrons are required to do this as the nucleus grows more massive? At first the number of neutrons required is roughly equal to the number of protons. The helium-4 nucleus contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, the carbon-12 nucleus contains 6 protons and 6 neutrons, the oxygen-16 nucleus contains 8 protons and 8 neutrons, and so on.</p></div> </div>
