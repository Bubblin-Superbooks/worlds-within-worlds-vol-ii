<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For more complicated nuclei, additional neutrons are needed. In vanadium-51, the nucleus contains 23 protons and 28 neutrons, five more than an equal amount. In bismuth-209, it is 83 protons and 126 neutrons, 43 more than an equal amount. For still more massive nuclei containing a larger number of protons, no amount of neutrons is sufficient to keep the assembly stable. The more massive nuclei are all radioactive.</p><p>The manner of radioactive breakdown fits the theory, too. Suppose a nucleus gives off an alpha particle. The alpha particle is a helium nucleus made up of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. If a nucleus loses an alpha particle, its mass number should decline by 4 and its atomic number by 2, and that is what happens.</p></div> </div>
