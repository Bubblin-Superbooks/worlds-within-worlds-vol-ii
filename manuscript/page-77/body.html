<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Of course, it is also possible that all 6 particles were spinning in the same direction; all +&frac12; or all -&frac12;. In that case the nuclear spin would be 3, either in one direction or the 93 other. If 5 particles were spinning in one direction and 1 in the other, then the total spin would be 2, in one direction or the other.</p><p>Wolfgang Pauli lecturing in Copenhagen in April 1929.</p><p>In short if you have an even number of particles in a nucleus, each with a spin of +&frac12; or -&frac12;, then the total spin is either zero or a whole number, no matter what combination of positive and negative spins you choose. (The total spin is always written as a positive number.)</p></div> </div>
