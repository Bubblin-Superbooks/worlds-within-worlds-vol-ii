<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As particle accelerators grew larger, more efficient, and more powerful, they became ever more useful in studying the structure of the nucleus and the nature of the subatomic particles themselves. They did not serve, however, to bring the dream of useful nuclear energy any closer. Though they brought about the liberation of vastly more nuclear energy than Rutherford&rsquo;s initial bombardments could, they also consumed a great deal more energy in the process.</p><p>It is not surprising that Rutherford, the pioneer in nuclear bombardment, was pessimistic. To the end of his days (he died in 1937) he maintained that it would be forever impossible to tap the energy of the nucleus for use by man. Hopes that &ldquo;nuclear power&rdquo; might some day run the world&rsquo;s industries were, in his view, an idle dream.</p></div> </div>
