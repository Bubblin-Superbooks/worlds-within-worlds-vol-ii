There are now, at this time of writing, &ldquo;proton synchrotrons&rdquo; (descendants of that first cyclotron) that produce particles with over a million times the energy of those produced by Lawrence&rsquo;s first cyclotron. Of course, the first cyclotron was only a quarter of a meter wide, while the largest today has a diameter of some 2000 meters.</p></div> </div>
