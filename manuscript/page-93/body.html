<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As soon as the neutron was discovered, the German physicist Werner Karl Heisenberg (1901- ) revived the notion that the nucleus must be made up of protons and neutrons, rather than protons and electrons. It was very easy to switch from the latter theory to the former, if one simply remembered to pair the electrons thought to be in the nucleus with protons and give the name neutrons to these combinations.</p><p>Thus, the helium-4 nucleus, rather than being made up of 4 protons and 2 electrons, was made up of 2 protons and 2 proton-electron combinations; or 2 protons and 2 neutrons. In the same way the oxygen-16 nucleus instead of being made up of 16 protons and 8 electrons, would be made up of 8 protons and 8 neutrons.</p></div> </div>
