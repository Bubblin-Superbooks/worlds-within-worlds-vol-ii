As the speed of light was approached, its length would approach zero in the direction of motion, while its mass would approach the infinite.</p><p>Could this really be so? Ordinary objects never moved so fast as to make their lengths and masses show any measurable change. What about subatomic particles, however, which moved at tens of thousands of kilometers per second? The German physicist Alfred Heinrich Bucherer (1863-1927) reported in 1908 that speeding electrons did gain in mass just the amount predicted by Einstein&rsquo;s theory. The increased mass with energy has been confirmed with great precision in recent years. Einstein&rsquo;s special theory of relativity has met many experimental tests exactly ever since and it is generally accepted by physicists today.</p></div> </div>
