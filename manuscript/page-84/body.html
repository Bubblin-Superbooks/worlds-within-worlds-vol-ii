<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Throughout the 1920s scientists searched for the neutron but without success.</p><p>One of the troubles was that the particle was electrically neutral. Subatomic particles could be detected in a variety of ways, but every single way (right down to the present time) makes use of their electric charge. The electric charge of a speeding subatomic particle either repels electrons or attracts them. In either case, electrons are knocked off atoms that are encountered by the speeding subatomic particle.</p><p>The atoms with electrons knocked off are now positively charged ions. Droplets of water vapor can form about these ions, or a bubble of gas can form, or a spark of light can be seen. The droplets, the bubbles, and the light can all be detected one way or another and the path of the subatomic particle could be followed by the trail of ions it left behind. Gamma rays, though they carry no charge, are a wave form capable of ionizing atoms.</p></div> </div>
