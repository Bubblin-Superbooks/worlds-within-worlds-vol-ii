<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Actually, though, physicists didn&rsquo;t have to worry about making neutrons energetic. This was a hangover from their work with positively charged particles such as protons and alpha particles. These charged particles had to be energetic to overcome the repulsion of the nucleus and to smash into it with enough force to break it up.</p><p>Neutrons, however, didn&rsquo;t have to overcome any repulsion. No matter how little energy they had, if they were correctly aimed (and some always were, through sheer chance) they would approach and strike the nucleus.</p><p>In fact, the more slowly they travelled, the longer they would stay in the vicinity of a nucleus and the more likely they were to be captured by some nearby nucleus through the attraction of the nuclear interaction. The influence of the nucleus in capturing the neutron was greater the slower the neutron, so that it was almost as though the nucleus were 109 larger and easier to hit for a slow neutron than a fast one.</p></div> </div>
