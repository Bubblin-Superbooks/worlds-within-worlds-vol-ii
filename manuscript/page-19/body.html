<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The results of the Michelson-Morley experiment were unexpected. It showed no difference in the measured speed of light. No matter what the direction of the beam&mdash;whether it went in the direction of the earth&rsquo;s movement, or against it, or at any angle to it&mdash;the speed of light always appeared to be exactly the same.</p><p>To explain this, the German-Swiss-American scientist Albert Einstein (1879-1955) advanced his &ldquo;special theory of relativity&rdquo; in 1905. According to Einstein&rsquo;s view, speeds could not merely be added. A ball thrown forward at 20 kilometers an hour by a man moving at 20 kilometers an hour in the same direction would not seem to be going 40 kilometers an hour to an observer at the roadside. It would seem to be going very slightly less than 40 kilometers an hour; so slightly less that the difference couldn&rsquo;t be measured.</p></div> </div>
