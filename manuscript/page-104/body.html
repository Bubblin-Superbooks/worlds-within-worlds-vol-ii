<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The proton would now be repelled by the positive charge of the nucleus and would go flying away. That is why atomic nuclei have to be so small; it is only when they are so tiny that the nuclear interaction can hold them together.</p><p>In 1932 Heisenberg tried to work out how these interactions might come into being. He suggested that attractions and repulsions were the result of particles being constantly and rapidly exchanged by the bodies experiencing the attractions and repulsions. Under some conditions, these &ldquo;exchange particles&rdquo; moving back and forth very rapidly between 2 bodies might force those bodies apart; under other conditions they might pull those bodies together.</p><p>In the case of the electromagnetic interaction, the exchange particles seemed to be &ldquo;photons&rdquo;, wave packets that made up gamma rays, X rays, or even ordinary light (all of which are examples of &ldquo;electromagnetic radiation&rdquo;).</p></div> </div>
