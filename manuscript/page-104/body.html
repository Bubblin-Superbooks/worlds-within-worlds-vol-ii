It is for this 103 reason that gravitational and electromagnetic interactions can make themselves felt over millions of miles of space.</p><p>But now, with the acceptance of the proton-neutron theory of nuclear structure, physicists began to suspect the existence of a third interaction&mdash;a &ldquo;nuclear interaction&rdquo;&mdash;much stronger than the electromagnetic interaction, perhaps 130 times as strong. Furthermore, the nuclear interaction had to decline very rapidly with distance much more rapidly than the electromagnetic interaction did.</p><p>In that case, protons in virtual contact, as within the nucleus, would attract each other, but if the distance between them was increased sufficiently to place one outside the nucleus, the nuclear interaction would decrease in intensity to less than the electromagnetic repulsion.</p></div> </div>
