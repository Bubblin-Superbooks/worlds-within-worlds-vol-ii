<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>To shift the protons within the nucleus (&ldquo;nuclear reactions&rdquo;) and make nuclear energy available was a harder problem by far. The particles involved were much more massive than electrons and correspondingly harder to move. What&rsquo;s more, they were buried deep within the atom. No temperatures available to the physicists of the 1920s could force atoms to smash together hard enough to reach and shake the nucleus.</p><p>In fact, the only objects that were known to reach the nucleus were speeding subatomic particles. As early as 1906, for instance, Rutherford had used the speeding alpha particles given off by a radioactive substance to bombard matter and to show that sometimes these alpha particles were deflected by atomic nuclei. It was, in fact, by such an experiment that he first demonstrated the existence of such nuclei.</p></div> </div>
