<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The fact that the neutron was just about as massive as the proton was to be expected if the neutron were a proton-electron combination. It was also not surprising that the isolated neutron eventually breaks up, giving up an electron and becoming a proton. Out of any large number of neutrons, half have turned into protons in about 12 minutes.</p><p>Nevertheless, although in some ways we can explain the neutron by speaking of it as though it were a proton-electron combination, it really is not. A neutron has a spin of &frac12; while a proton-electron combination would have a spin of either 0 or 1. The neutron, therefore, must be treated as a single uncharged particle.</p></div> </div>
