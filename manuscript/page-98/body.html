<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Suppose a nucleus gives off a beta particle. For a moment, that might seem puzzling. If the nucleus contains only protons and neutrons and no electrons, where does the beta particle come from? Suppose we consider the neutrons 101 as proton-electron combinations. Within many nuclei, the neutrons are quite stable and do not break up as they do in isolation. In the case of certain nuclei, however, they do break up.</p><p>Thus the thorium-234 nucleus is made up of 90 protons and 144 neutrons. One of these neutrons might be viewed as breaking up to liberate an electron and leaving behind an unbound proton. If a beta particle leaves then, the number of neutrons decreases by one and the number of protons increases by one. The thorium-234 nucleus (90 protons, 144 neutrons) becomes a protactinium-234 nucleus (91 protons, 143 neutrons).</p></div> </div>
