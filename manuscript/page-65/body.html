Protons carry a positive charge and a force can therefore be exerted upon them by an electric or magnetic field. In a device that makes use of such fields, protons can be accelerated (made to go faster and faster), and thus gain more and more energy. In the end, if enough energy is gained, the proton could do more damage than the alpha particle, despite the former&rsquo;s smaller mass. Combine that with the smaller repulsion involved and the greater ease of obtaining protons&mdash;and the weight of convenience and usefulness would swing far in the direction of the proton.</p></div> </div>
