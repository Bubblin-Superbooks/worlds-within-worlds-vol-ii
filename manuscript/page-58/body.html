If that were so, candles would be impractical.</p><p>In fact, the most dramatic result of alpha particle bombardment had nothing to do with energy production, but rather the reverse. New nuclei were produced that had more energy than the starting nuclei, so that energy was absorbed by the nuclear reaction rather than given off.</p><p>This came about first in 1934, when a French husband-and-wife team of physicists, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Joliot-Curie (1900-1958) and Ir&egrave;ne Joliot-Curie (1897-1956) were bombarding aluminum-27 (atomic number 13) with alpha particles.</p></div> </div>
