However, among the objects they placed in the path of the new radiation, they included paraffin, which is made up of the light atoms of carbon and hydrogen. To their surprise, protons were knocked out of the paraffin.</p><p>Gamma rays had never been observed to do this, but the Joliot-Curies could not think what else the radiation might be. They simply reported that they had discovered gamma rays to be capable of a new kind of action.</p><p>James Chadwick</p><p>Not so the English physicist James Chadwick (1891- ). In that same year he maintained that a gamma ray, which possessed no mass, simply lacked the momentum to hurl a proton out of its place in the atom. Even an electron was too light to do so.</p></div> </div>
