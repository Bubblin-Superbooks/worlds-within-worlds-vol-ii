<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This &ldquo;proton-electron theory&rdquo; of nuclear structure accounted for isotopes very nicely. While oxygen-16 had a nucleus made up of 16 protons and 8 electrons, oxygen-17 had one of 17 protons and 9 electrons, and oxygen-18 had one of 18 protons and 10 electrons. The mass numbers were 16, 17, and 18, respectively, but the atomic number was 16 - 8, 17 - 9, and 18 - 10, or 8 in each case.</p><p>Again, uranium-238 has a nucleus built up, according to this theory, of 238 protons and 146 electrons, while uranium-235 has one built up of 235 protons and 143 electrons. In these cases the atomic number is, respectively, 238 - 146 and 235 - 143, or 92 in each case. The nucleus of the 2 isotopes is, however, of different structure and it is not surprising therefore that the radioactive properties of the 78 two&mdash;properties that involve the nucleus&mdash;</p></div> </div>
