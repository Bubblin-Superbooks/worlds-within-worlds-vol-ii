The only thing that could do so would be a negative electric charge and these were to be found only on electrons as far as anyone knew in 1914. It seemed reasonable, then, to suppose that a nucleus would contain about half as many electrons in addition to the protons. The electrons were so light, they wouldn&rsquo;t affect the mass much, and they would succeed in cancelling some of the positive charge.</p><p>Thus, according to this early theory, now known to be incorrect, the helium nucleus contained not only 4 protons, but 2 electrons in addition. The helium nucleus would then have a mass number of 4 and an electric charge (atomic number) of 4 - 2, or 2. This was in accordance with observation.</p></div> </div>
