If a nucleus was made up of x protons and y neutrons, then the atomic number was equal to x and the mass number to x + y. (It is now possible to define the mass number of a nucleus in modern terms. It is the number of protons plus neutrons in the nucleus.)</p><p>Werner Heisenberg</p><p>The proton-neutron theory of nuclear structure could account for isotopes perfectly well, too. Consider the 3 oxygen isotopes, oxygen-16, oxygen-17, and oxygen-18. The 100 first would have a nucleus made up of 8 protons and 8 neutrons; the second, one of 8 protons and 9 neutrons; and the third, one of 8 protons and 10 neutrons. In each case the atomic number is 8. The mass numbers however would be 16, 17, and 18, respectively.</p></div> </div>
