And if one argued like that, then it seemed that the radiation first observed by Bothe and Becker had to be the 98 long-sought-for proton-electron combination. Chadwick used Harkins&rsquo; term, neutron, for it and made it official. He gets the credit for the discovery of the neutron.</p><p>Chadwick managed to work out the mass of the neutron from his experiments and by 1934 it was quite clear that the neutron was more massive than the proton. The best modern data have the mass of the proton set at 1.007825, and that of the neutron just a trifle greater at 1.008665.</p></div> </div>
