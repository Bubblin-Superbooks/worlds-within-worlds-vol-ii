<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The result was to combine part of the alpha particle with the aluminum-27 nucleus to form a new nucleus with an atomic number two units higher&mdash;15&mdash;and a mass number three units higher&mdash;30.</p><p>The element with atomic number 15 is phosphorus so that phosphorus-30 was formed. The only isotope of phosphorus 86 that occurs in nature, however, is phosphorus-31. Phosphorus-30 was the first man-made nucleus&mdash;the first to be manufactured by nuclear reactions in the laboratory.</p><p>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric and Ir&egrave;ne Joliot-Curie</p><p>The reason phosphorus-30 did not occur in nature was that its energy content was too high to allow it to be stable. Its energy content drained away through the emission of particles that allowed the nucleus to change over into a stable one, silicon-30 (atomic number 14). This was an example of &ldquo;artificial radioactivity&rdquo;.</p></div> </div>
