On the other hand the 8 alpha particles involve a decrease in atomic number of 8 &times; 2, or 16, while the 6 beta particles involve an increase in atomic number of 6 &times; 1, or 6. The total change is a decrease of 16 - 6, or 10. And indeed, uranium (atomic number 92) changes to lead (atomic number 82).</p><p>It is useful to go into such detail concerning the proton-electron theory of nuclear structure and to describe how attractive it seemed. The theory appeared solid and unshakable and, indeed, physicists used it with considerable satisfaction for 15 years.</p></div> </div>
