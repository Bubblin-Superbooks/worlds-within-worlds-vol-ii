<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Measured in terms of this natural unit of spin, the proton and the electron have spin &frac12;. If the particle spun in one direction it was +&frac12;, if in the other it was -&frac12;.</p><p>When subatomic particles came together to form an atomic nucleus, each kept its original spin, and the nuclear spin was then equal to the total angular momentum of the individual particles that made it up.</p><p>For instance, suppose the helium nucleus is made up of 4 protons and 2 electrons, as was thought in the 1920s. Of the 4 protons, suppose that two had a spin of +&frac12; and two of -&frac12;. Suppose also that of the 2 electrons, one had a spin of +&frac12; and one of -&frac12;. All the spins would cancel each other. The total angular momentum would be zero.</p></div> </div>
