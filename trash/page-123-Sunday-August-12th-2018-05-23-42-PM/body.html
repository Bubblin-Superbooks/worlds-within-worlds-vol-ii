<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It might seem that hope could now rise in connection with the practical use of energy derived from nuclear reactions. Neutrons could bring about nuclear reactions, even when they themselves possessed very little energy, so output might conceivably be more than input for each neutron that struck. Furthermore because of the large cross sections involved, thermal neutrons missed far less frequently than high-energy charged particles did.</p><p>But there was a catch. Before neutrons could be used, however low-energy and however sure to hit, they had to be produced; and in order to produce neutrons they had to be knocked out of nuclei by bombardment with high-energy protons or some other such method. The energy formed by the neutrons was at first never more than the tiniest fraction of the energies that went into forming the neutrons in the first place.</p></div> </div>
