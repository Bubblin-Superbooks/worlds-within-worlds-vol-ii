<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As soon as neutrons were discovered, it seemed to physicists that they had another possible bombarding particle of extraordinary properties. Since the neutron lacked any electric charge, it could not be repelled by either electrons on the outside of the atoms or by the nuclei at the center. The neutron was completely indifferent to the electromagnetic attraction and it just moved along in a straight line. If it happened to be headed toward a nucleus it would strike it no matter how heavy a charge that nucleus might have and very often it would, as a result, induce a nuclear reaction where a proton would not have been able to.</p><p>J. Robert Oppenheimer</p><p>To be sure, it seemed just at first that there was a disadvantage to the neutron&rsquo;s lack of charge.</p></div> </div>
