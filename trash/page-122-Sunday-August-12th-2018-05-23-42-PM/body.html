<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A billiard ball, colliding with a cannon ball, will just bounce, moving just as rapidly afterward as before, though in a different direction. If a billiard ball strikes another billiard ball, it will set the target ball moving and bounce off itself with less speed.)</p><p>The energy of the molecules in the atmosphere depends on temperature. Neutrons that match that energy and have the ordinary quantity to be expected at room temperature are called &ldquo;thermal&rdquo; (from a Greek word meaning &ldquo;heat&rdquo;) neutrons. The comparatively light nuclei against which the 110 neutrons bounce and slow down are &ldquo;moderators&rdquo; because they moderate the neutron&rsquo;s energy.</p><p>Fermi and his co-workers were the first to moderate neutrons, produce thermal neutrons, and use them, in 1935, to bombard nuclei. He quickly noted how large nuclear cross sections became when thermal neutrons were the bombarding particles.</p></div> </div>
