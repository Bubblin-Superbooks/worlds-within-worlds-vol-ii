<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Since this mass is intermediate between that of an electron and proton, such particles eventually came to be called &ldquo;mesons&rdquo; from a Greek word meaning &ldquo;intermediate&rdquo;.</p><p>Once Yukawa published his theory, the search was on for the hypothetical mesons. Ideally, if they existed within the nucleus, shooting back and forth between protons and neutrons, there ought to be some way of knocking them out of the nucleus and studying them in isolation. Unfortunately, the bombarding particles at the disposal of physicists in the 1930s possessed far too little energy to knock mesons out of nuclei, assuming they were there in the first place.</p><p>There was one way out. In 1911 the Austrian physicist Victor Francis Hess (1883-1964) had discovered that earth was bombarded from every side by &ldquo;cosmic rays&rdquo;.</p></div> </div>
